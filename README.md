Explore a depiction of the TRAPPIST-1 system, a collection of seven terrestrial planets hugging close to a small 
ultracool red dwarf star. All the planets are tidally locked, with one side always facing their sun and the other 
always facing away. Three of the planets are in the habitable zone, making the TRAPPIST-1 system one of the most 
promising known places to find extraterrestrial life.  
  
Depictions are purely speculative, based on unfinished and contradictory research, not to mention the fact this is all 
made in a video game. Check the sources for more accurate and in-depth info.
